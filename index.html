			For the original level, I was involved in building the basic scenery as well as the final layout placement of enemies and items. 
			I implemented the run-jump-shoot behaviors of the character, all the enemies, as well as the lava and the audio.

			For the custom level, I mainly designed the illusory floor traps as well as some of the laser traps. I was involved in the final layout and was mainly responsible
